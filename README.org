** Abstract

The *foundational* and *practical* guide for *effectively learning* fundamental
blockchain concepts and *progressively building* a blockchain in Go from
scratch. An interesting and challenging adventure that takes you from
*foundational concepts and purpose* through *technical design and
implementation* to *practical testing and usage*
