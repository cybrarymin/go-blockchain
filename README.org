* Go blockchain

Note: if you find this guide useful, please, *share the guide with your
friends*, so they take the same advantage as you do by learning the fundamental
blockchain concepts and practicing how to build a blockchain in Go from scratch

** Abstract

The *foundational* and *practical* guide for *effectively learning* fundamental
blockchain concepts and *progressively building* a blockchain in Go from
scratch. An interesting and challenging adventure that takes you from
*foundational concepts and purpose* through *technical design and
implementation* to *practical testing and usage* of the developed blockchain

- Simple, yet non-trivial :: The guide introduce the blockchain concepts simple
  to understand and technical design solutions simple to implement. However, the
  proposed blockchain is not trivial. The blockchain has all key components of
  modern blockchains: the state initialization and synchronization, the peer
  discovery, the transaction relay, the block proposer, the block validators,
  the PoA centralized consensus, the block relay, the event stream, the gRPC
  server, and the graceful node shutdown
- Concise, yet detailed :: The guide describes blockchain concepts and technical
  design solutions in the concise and clear form, focusing on the purpose what
  and the reasons why behind fundamental blockchain components. Enough details
  behind technical design solutions are provided to support deep understanding
  of internal working of components of the proposed blockchain
- Practical, yet well-grounded :: The guide emphasizes the learn by doing
  approach to effectively understanding the blockchain concepts and
  progressively building the blockchain components from scratch. Practical
  experience of developing, testing, and using the proposed blockchain is a
  great motivator to get deeper understanding of the blockchain concepts and the
  technical design solutions. Once the key mechanics of the blockchain
  components are understood, the more abstract theoretical concepts naturally
  fill the gaps of practical knowledge
