* Transaction

** Concepts and purpose

*** Cryptographic hash function

- Hash function :: The cryptographic hash function produces a random-looking,
  fixed-length, unpredictable output (the random oracle) from an arbitrary large
  input. The hash function is deterministic: the same input produces the same
  output. A tiny change in the input produces a completely different output.
  Security properties of a hash function
  - Pre-image resistance :: The hash function is a one-way function: given a
    hash, it is almost impossible to find the original input
  - Second pre-image resistance :: Given an input and the hash of the input, it
    is almost impossible to find another input that has the same hash
  - Collision resistance :: It is almost impossible to find two different inputs
    that have the same hash. Collisions are inevitable because the output length
    is fixed, while the input is arbitrary large
- Hash function and digital signature :: The hash function is used to check data
  integrity of a message and its copy. The hash of a message is a unique
  identifier of the message. Digitally signing a hash of a message is as secure
  as signing the message itself, but much faster

*** Blockchain transactions

- Blockchain transaction :: The blockchain transaction transfers the value from
  a sender account to a recipient account. Every transaction must be digitally
  signed by the sender account that authorizes the transfer of funds and
  authenticates the transaction. Multiple transactions are included in a block,
  which, in turn, is added to the confirmed state and the local block store of
  the blockchain node, once the consensus agreement is reached between nodes on
  the blockchain. Confirmed transactions are irreversible. Confirmed
  transactions are immutable. It is almost impossible to change the order or
  content of confirmed transactions
- Double spending problem :: The situation when the same digital asset can be
  spent more then once. Only one of multiple transactions spending the same
  asset should be validated and confirmed while others transactions must be
  rejected. This blockchain prevents the double spending problem by tracking in
  the blockchain state both: the account balance to check for availability of
  funds, and the per-account monotonically increasing nonce to order
  transactions signed from the same account
- Transaction nonce :: The transaction nonce is a unique usually monotonically
  increasing number used once per account to prevent the double spending
  problem, transaction replay attacks, and ensure that each transaction from an
  account is processed in order

*** Signing and verification of transactions

- Digital signature :: The private signing key is used to produce a digital
  signature of a transaction. The corresponding public verifying key is used to
  verify the digital signature of a transaction. The digital signature proves
  the authenticity of a sender (origin authentication), the non-repudiation of a
  sender, and the integrity of a transaction (message authentication)
- Sign transaction :: The hash of an encoded transaction is signed with the
  private key of the signing account. The sign operation produces a signature
  that is used to verify the signed transaction
- Verify transaction :: The public key is recovered from the hash of the encoded
  transaction and the transaction signature. The account address derived from
  the recovered public key is compared with the account address of the sender of
  the signed transaction. If both addresses are equal, then the signature is
  valid. A valid signature guarantees
  - Sender authenticity :: The transaction has been signed by the owner of the
    sender account, if the account private key has not been compromised
  - Sender non-repudiation :: The sender cannot deny the act of sending the
    validated and confirmed transaction, as the transaction must have been
    signed with the private key of the sender account
  - Transaction integrity :: The transaction content is immutable since
    creation and has not been tampered with

*** Transaction search

- Transaction search :: The transaction search function locates confirmed
  transactions on the blockchain after the transactions have been validated and
  applied to the confirmed state and appended to the local block store. The
  transaction search is performed against the local block store of the
  blockchain node. The difference between the transaction search and the
  subscription to the node event stream is that the node event stream allows
  clients to proactively subscribe to the validated transaction event type
  before transactions are validated and the event will be delivered only once,
  while the transaction search locates transactions on demand as many times as
  required after transactions have been validated and confirmed. The transaction
  search locates validated and confirmed transactions in the local block store
  by the prefix of the transaction hash, by the prefix of the sender account
  address, by the prefix of the recipient account address, and by the prefix of
  the account involved as a sender or as a recipient in a transaction

** Design and implementation

*** Keccak256 hash function

Keccak256 hash function is used in this blockchain for hashing and signing of
transactions, blocks, and the genesis

- Keccak256 hash function :: The =Hash= type is a type alias to =[32]byte=. The
  Keccak256 hash function is implemented as the constructor function on the hash
  type. To hash a value of a specific type, this implementation requires the
  type to have defined the JSON serialization that is used to encode the value
  before hashing. The hash type defines string and byte slice representations of
  the hash, as well as the JSON text marshal and unmarshal serialization methods
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
type Hash [32]byte

func NewHash(val any) Hash {
  jval, _ := json.Marshal(val)
  hash := make([]byte, 64)
  sha3.ShakeSum256(hash, jval)
  return Hash(hash[:32])
}

func (h Hash) String() string {
  return hex.EncodeToString(h[:])
}

func (h Hash) Bytes() []byte {
  hash := [32]byte(h)
  return hash[:]
}

func (h Hash) MarshalText() ([]byte, error) {
  return []byte(hex.EncodeToString(h[:])), nil
}

func (h *Hash) UnmarshalText(hash []byte) error {
  _, err := hex.Decode(h[:], hash)
  return err
}
  #+END_SRC

*** Transaction and signed transaction types

This implementation makes distinction between the initial transaction type =Tx=
before signing and the signed transaction type =SigTx= after signing. The =Tx=
type is only used for initial creation of a transaction, signing of a new
transaction, and verification of the signed transaction. Most of the blockchain
components work exclusively with the =SigTx= type

- Transaction type :: The =Tx= type represents a transaction on the blockchain.
  The transaction defines the address of a sender account, the address of a
  recipient account, the value amount to be transferred, the per account nonce
  to prevent the transaction replay attacks, the double spending problem, and
  process transaction signed from an account in order, and, finally, the time of
  creation of the transaction. All transaction fields participate in producing
  the hash of the transaction that is used to sign the transaction
  | ~From Address~   | Sender account address    |
  | ~To Address~     | Recipient account address |
  | ~Value uint64~   | Value amount              |
  | ~Nonce uint64~   | Per account nonce         |
  | ~Time time.Time~ | Creation time             |
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
type Tx struct {
  From Address `json:"from"`
  To Address `json:"to"`
  Value uint64 `json:"value"`
  Nonce uint64 `json:"nonce"`
  Time time.Time `json:"time"`
}

func NewTx(from, to Address, value, nonce uint64) Tx {
  return Tx{From: from, To: to, Value: value, Nonce: nonce, Time: time.Now()}
}

func (t Tx) Hash() Hash {
  return NewHash(t)
}
  #+END_SRC

- Signed transaction type :: The =SigTx= type embeds the =Tx= type and includes
  the transaction signature. The string representation of a signed transaction
  is defined to present the transaction to the end user
  | ~Tx~         | Embedded original transaction                 |
  | ~Sig []byte~ | Digital signature of the original transaction |
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
type SigTx struct {
  Tx
  Sig []byte `json:"sig"`
}

func NewSigTx(tx Tx, sig []byte) SigTx {
  return SigTx{Tx: tx, Sig: sig}
}

func (t SigTx) Hash() Hash {
  return NewHash(t)
}

func (t SigTx) String() string {
  return fmt.Sprintf(
    "tx %.7s: %.7s -> %.7s %8d %8d", t.Hash(), t.From, t.To, t.Value, t.Nonce,
  )
}
  #+END_SRC

*** ECDSA signing and verification of transactions

This blockchain uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for
signing and verification of signed transactions. Specifically, the Secp256k1
elliptic curve is used for signing and verification of signed transactions

- Secp256k1 sign transaction :: The transaction signing process requires the
  owner-provided password and is performed from the account of the sender. The
  transaction signing process
  - Produce the Keccak256 hash of the input transaction
  - Sign the Keccak256 hash of the transaction using the ECDSA algorithm on the
    Secp256k1 elliptic curve
  - Construct the signed transaction by adding the produced digital signature to
    the original transaction
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
func (a Account) SignTx(tx Tx) (SigTx, error) {
  hash := tx.Hash().Bytes()
  sig, err := ecc.SignBytes(a.prv, hash, ecc.LowerS | ecc.RecID)
  if err != nil {
    return SigTx{}, err
  }
  stx := NewSigTx(tx, sig)
  return stx, nil
}
  #+END_SRC

- Secp256k1 verify transaction :: The transaction verification process does not
  require any external information like the owner-provided password for a signed
  transaction to be verified. The signed transaction instance contains all the
  necessary information to verify the signature of the signed transaction. The
  transaction verification process
  - Recover the public key from the hash of the original embedded transaction
    and the transaction signature
  - Derive the account address from the recovered public key
  - If the derived account address is equal to the account address of the sender
    of the signed transaction, then the transaction signature is valid
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
func VerifyTx(tx SigTx) (bool, error) {
  hash := tx.Tx.Hash().Bytes()
  pub, err := ecc.RecoverPubkey("P-256k1", hash, tx.Sig)
  if err != nil {
    return false, err
  }
  acc := NewAddress(pub)
  return acc == tx.From, nil
}
  #+END_SRC

*** gRPC =TxSign= method

The gRPC =Tx= service provides the =TxSign= method to digitally sign a new
transaction before sending the transaction to the blockchain node for
validation. The interface of the service
#+BEGIN_SRC protobuf
message TxSignReq {
  string From = 1;
  string To = 2;
  uint64 Value = 3;
  string Password = 4;
}

message TxSignRes {
  bytes Tx = 1;
}

service Tx {
  rpc TxSign(TxSignReq) returns (TxSignRes);
}
#+END_SRC

The implementation of the =TxSign= method
- Re-create the owner account from the local key store using the owner-provided
  password
- Construct a new transaction from the request arguments
  - =From= specifies the sender address
  - =To= specifies the recipient address
  - =Value= indicates the value amount to be transferred
- Request from the pending state and increment by 1 the current value of the
  nonce for the sender account
- Sign the transaction with the sender account private key
- Encode the signed transaction
- Return the encoded signed transaction to the client
#+BEGIN_SRC go
func (s *TxSrv) TxSign(_ context.Context, req *TxSignReq) (*TxSignRes, error) {
  path := filepath.Join(s.keyStoreDir, req.From)
  acc, err := chain.ReadAccount(path, []byte(req.Password))
  if err != nil {
    return nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, err.Error())
  }
  tx := chain.NewTx(
    chain.Address(req.From), chain.Address(req.To), req.Value,
    s.txApplier.Nonce(chain.Address(req.From)) + 1,
  )
  stx, err := acc.SignTx(tx)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Internal, err.Error())
  }
  jtx, err := json.Marshal(stx)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Internal, err.Error())
  }
  res := &TxSignRes{Tx: jtx}
  return res, nil
}
#+END_SRC

*** gRPC =TxSearch= method

The gRPC =Tx= service provides the =TxSearch= method to locate confirmed
transactions on the local block store. The transactions that satisfy the search
criteria are returned to the client through the gRPC server stream. The
interface of the service
#+BEGIN_SRC protobuf
message TxSearchReq {
  string Hash = 1;
  string From = 2;
  string To = 3;
  string Account = 4;
}

message TxSearchRes {
  bytes Tx = 1;
}

service Tx {
  rpc TxSearch(TxSearchReq) returns (stream TxSearchRes);
}
#+END_SRC

The implementation of the =TxSearch= method
- Create the iterator over the blocks in the local block store
- Defer closing the iterator
- Iterate over each block in the local block store in order. For each block
  - Iterate over each transaction of the confirmed block. For each transaction
    - Search by the transaction hash prefix
      - Send the first transaction that matches the requested transaction hash
        prefix over the gRPC server stream and stop the transaction search
        process
    - Search by the prefix of the sender, recipient, or account address
      - Send every transaction that matches the search criteria over the gRPC
        server stream and keep searching transactions until all transactions in
        all blocks of the local block store are searched
#+BEGIN_SRC go
func (s *TxSrv) TxSearch(
  req *TxSearchReq, stream grpc.ServerStreamingServer[TxSearchRes],
) error {
  blocks, closeBlocks, err := chain.ReadBlocks(s.blockStoreDir)
  if err != nil {
    return status.Errorf(codes.NotFound, err.Error())
  }
  defer closeBlocks()
  prefix := strings.HasPrefix
  block: for err, blk := range blocks {
    if err != nil {
      return status.Errorf(codes.Internal, err.Error())
    }
    for _, tx := range blk.Txs {
      if len(req.Hash) > 0 && prefix(tx.Hash().String(), req.Hash) {
        err = sendTxSearchRes(blk, tx, stream)
        if err != nil {
          return status.Errorf(codes.Internal, err.Error())
        }
        break block
      }
      if len(req.From) > 0 && prefix(string(tx.From), req.From) ||
        len(req.To) > 0 && prefix(string(tx.To), req.To) ||
        len(req.Account) > 0 &&
          (prefix(string(tx.From), req.From) || prefix(string(tx.To), req.To)) {
        err := sendTxSearchRes(blk, tx, stream)
        if err != nil {
          return status.Errorf(codes.Internal, err.Error())
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return nil
}
