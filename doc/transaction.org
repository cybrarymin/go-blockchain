* Transaction

*** Signing and verifying transactions

- Sign transaction :: A hash of an encoded /transaction is signed with a private
  key/. The sign operation produces a signature that is used to verify the
  signed transaction
- Verify transaction :: A /public key is recovered/ from the hash of an encoded
  transaction and the associated signature. An account address derived from the
  recovered public key is compared with the =From= address of the signed
  transaction. If both addresses match, the signature is valid. A valid
  signatures guarantees /integrity of the transaction/ (the transaction has not
  been tampered with) and /authenticity of the transaction/ (the transaction has
  been signed by the owner of the =From= account) if the account private key has
  not been compromised
